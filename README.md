# iris-flower-classifier
This is a beginner machine learning project built using Python and the scikit-learn library.

It uses the Iris flower dataset to train a Decision Tree model. The model learns to predict the type of iris flower based on four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The flower types are:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The model gives a high accuracy and can guess the correct flower when new data is given.
